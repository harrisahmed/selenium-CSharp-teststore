Bug 1
Title: Incorrect Adjustment of Minimum Price Range

Scenario:
Given I am on the internal page with price adjustment section visible
And the minimum price range is initially set to R 5
When I increase the minimum price range to R 500.00
Then the minimum price displayed should be updated to R 500.00 

Expected Behavior: When I adjust the minimum price range , the displayed minimum price should accurately reflect the new setting, such as R 500.00 min price after setting the range to R 500.00.

Actual Behavior: increacing the minimum price range updates the display incorrectly to R 1,234.00 instead of reflecting the newly set range (e.g., R 500.00 min).

Bug 2:
Title: Unable to Receive Confirmation Email for New Account

Given I am on the registration page of the website
When I fill out the registration form with valid details
And submit the form
Then I should see the message "A confirmation email has been sent for your profile"
And I should receive a confirmation email in my inbox

Expected Behavior:  After submitting the registration form with valid details, the user should receive a confirmation email promptly.
Actual Behavior: The website displays the message confirming that a confirmation email has been sent, but the email is not received in the inbox. Consequently, the user cannot proceed with account activation.


Bug 3:
Title: Filter Options Not Remaining Visible When Selected
Given I am on the internal product page
And I can see three filters: New, In Stock, and Deals
When I click on the "In Stock" filter option
Then the "New" and "Deals" filter option should remain visible and clickable

Expected Behavior: When I select the "In Stock" filter option, the "Deals" filter option should still be visible and selectable alongside "In Stock" and vice versa.

Actual Behavior: After selecting "In Stock", the "Deals" filter option disappears from view, making it impossible to select both filters simultaneously.



Bug 4:
Title: Incorrect Adjustment of Maximum Price Range

Scenario:
Given I am on the internal page with the price adjustment section visible
And the maximum price range is initially set to R 1,234.00
When I decrease the maximum price range to R 800.00 per set
Then the maximum price displayed should be updated to R 800.00 per set

Expected Behavior: When I adjust the maximum price range downwards, the displayed maximum price should accurately reflect the new setting, such as R 800.00 max range.


Actual Behavior: Decreasing the maximum price range updates the display incorrectly to R 23.00 max instead of reflecting the newly set range (e.g., R 800.00 max).
